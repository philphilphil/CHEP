## Testing vs Stockfish
With [cutechess-cli](https://github.com/cutechess/cutechess) I ran automated tests after development milestones with 20 games against [Stockfish 9](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) on a certain level. Result is winsChep-winsSF-draws. PGN for the games in Testgames-Folder.
