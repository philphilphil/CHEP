# Spot üê±
Work in Progress UCI compliant Chess engine. Move gen via [dragontoothmg](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/dylhunn/dragontoothmg).
## Testing vs Stockfish
Out of interest how the  engine strength grows, I ran automated tests after development milestones with [c-chess-cli](https://github.com/lucasart/c-chess-cli). 20 games against [Stockfish 12](https://github.com/official-stockfish/Stockfish) on a certain level (20 is max with ELO ~3500). Result is winsSpot-draws-winsSF. Run on M1.
